This project develops a tract-level home value modeling framework for the City of Chicago using structural housing characteristics, spatial features, and neighborhood-level indicators. I use tract-level modeling rather than parcel-level modeling because it allows the analysis to capture systematic spatial variation in home values that may be obscured by noise in individual property data. Census tracts are intended to represent relatively homogeneous neighborhoods, making them an appropriate unit of analysis for examining how location and surrounding context influence housing values.
